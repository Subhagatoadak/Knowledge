## The Transformer Architecture: Step-by-Step

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), revolutionized sequence-to-sequence tasks (like machine translation, text summarization) by relying entirely on self-attention mechanisms, abandoning recurrence (RNNs) and convolution (CNNs) for sequence modeling.

**Core Idea:** Instead of processing words sequentially one by one (like RNNs), the Transformer processes all words in a sequence *simultaneously*. It uses **self-attention** to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing a specific word, and **cross-attention** (in the decoder) to weigh the importance of input words when generating an output word.

**High-Level View:** The Transformer typically consists of an **Encoder** stack and a **Decoder** stack.

* **Encoder:** Maps an input sequence of symbols $(x_1, ..., x_n)$ to a sequence of continuous representations $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, ..., z_n)$.
* **Decoder:** Given $\mathbf{z}$, generates an output sequence $(y_1, ..., y_m)$ one symbol at a time. At each step $i$, it uses the previously generated symbols $(y_1, ..., y_{i-1})$ and the encoder output $\mathbf{z}$ to produce the next symbol $y_i$.

**Detailed Steps:**

**1. Input Embedding:**

* **Purpose:** Convert input words (tokens) into numerical vectors of a fixed dimension ($d_{model}$).
* **Process:** Each word is looked up in an embedding matrix.
* **Example:** "Hello world" -> [Embedding(Hello), Embedding(world)] -> [vector1, vector2] where each vector has dimension $d_{model}$ (e.g., 512).

**2. Positional Encoding:**

* **Purpose:** Since the model processes words simultaneously without recurrence, it has no inherent notion of word order. Positional encodings inject information about the position of each word in the sequence.
* **Process:** Vectors of the same dimension ($d_{model}$) as the embeddings are created, typically using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies based on the position and vector dimension index.
    $$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})$$   $$PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})$$
    where `pos` is the word's position in the sequence and `i` is the index within the embedding dimension.
* **Action:** These positional encoding vectors are *added* to the corresponding input embedding vectors.

**3. The Encoder Stack:**

The encoder consists of $N$ identical layers (e.g., $N=6$). Each layer has two main sub-layers:

    **a. Multi-Head Self-Attention:**
        * **Purpose:** Allows each word in the input sequence to "attend" to all other words (including itself) in the *same* sequence to understand context. "Multi-Head" means doing this attention process multiple times in parallel with different learned projections.
        * **Mechanism (Single Head - Scaled Dot-Product Attention):**
            1.  **Create Q, K, V:** For each input vector (embedding + positional encoding), create three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) by multiplying the input vector with learned weight matrices ($W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$). These matrices project the input into different subspaces.
            2.  **Calculate Scores:** Compute the dot product of the Query vector of a word with the Key vectors of all words in the sequence: $Score = QK^T$. This measures how much attention a word (represented by Q) should pay to other words (represented by K).
            3.  **Scale:** Divide the scores by the square root of the dimension of the Key vectors ($\sqrt{d_k}$) to prevent gradients from becoming too small: $Scaled Scores = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$.
            4.  **Softmax:** Apply a softmax function to the scaled scores row-wise to get attention weights (probabilities that sum to 1): $Weights = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})$.
            5.  **Weighted Sum:** Multiply the attention weights by the Value vectors and sum them up: $Attention Output = Weights \cdot V$. This results in an output vector for each input position that is a weighted combination of all Value vectors, where the weights are determined by the Q-K interactions.
        * **Mechanism (Multi-Head):**
            1.  Project input vectors into $h$ lower-dimensional Q, K, V sets using different weight matrices ($W^Q_i, W^K_i, W^V_i$ for head $i=1...h$). The dimension of these is typically $d_k = d_v = d_{model} / h$.
            2.  Perform Scaled Dot-Product Attention independently for each head in parallel.
            3.  Concatenate the $h$ attention outputs ($head_1, ..., head_h$).
            4.  Linearly project the concatenated output using another weight matrix ($W^O$) back to the original dimension $d_{model}$.
            $$MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O$$           $$where \ head_i = Attention(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)$$

    **b. Add & Norm (Residual Connection + Layer Normalization):**
        * **Purpose:** Helps in training deep networks and stabilizes activations.
        * **Process:**
            1.  **Add:** The output of the multi-head attention sub-layer is added to the *input* of that sub-layer (residual connection): $Input + SublayerOutput$.
            2.  **Norm:** Layer Normalization is applied to the result of the addition. LayerNorm normalizes the activations across the features for a specific layer instance.

    **c. Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN):**
        * **Purpose:** Applies a non-linear transformation to each position's representation independently and identically. It helps model complex interactions within the representation.
        * **Process:** A simple two-layer fully connected network is applied to each position vector ($x$) coming out of the Add & Norm step:
            $$FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$$
            Typically, the inner layer has a larger dimension ($d_{ff}$, e.g., 2048 if $d_{model}=512$). ReLU ($max(0, \cdot)$) or GELU is often used as the activation function.

    **d. Add & Norm (Again):**
        * **Process:** Another residual connection followed by Layer Normalization is applied after the FFN sub-layer. The output of this step becomes the input to the next encoder layer or the final encoder output $\mathbf{z}$ if it's the last layer.

**4. The Decoder Stack:**

The decoder also consists of $N$ identical layers. Each layer has *three* main sub-layers:

    **a. Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention:**
        * **Purpose:** Allows each position in the *decoder input* sequence (i.e., the target sequence generated so far) to attend to previous positions in that same sequence.
        * **Difference from Encoder Self-Attention:** It's **masked** to prevent positions from attending to *future* positions. During training, we feed the entire target sequence, but when predicting word $i$, the model should only rely on words $1$ to $i-1$. This is achieved by setting the attention scores corresponding to future positions to $-\infty$ before the softmax step.

    **b. Add & Norm:**
        * **Process:** Same as in the encoder (residual connection + layer normalization).

    **c. Multi-Head Encoder-Decoder Attention (Cross-Attention):**
        * **Purpose:** Allows each position in the decoder to attend to *all positions* in the **encoder output sequence ($\mathbf{z}$)**. This is where the information from the input sequence is incorporated into the target sequence generation.
        * **Mechanism:** Similar to self-attention, but:
            * **Queries (Q)** come from the output of the previous decoder sub-layer (Masked Self-Attention + Add & Norm).
            * **Keys (K) and Values (V)** come from the **output of the encoder stack ($\mathbf{z}$)**.
        * There's no masking needed here (usually) because the decoder is allowed to look at the entire input sequence.

    **d. Add & Norm:**
        * **Process:** Same as before.

    **e. Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN):**
        * **Process:** Identical structure and purpose as the FFN in the encoder, applied to the output of the cross-attention + Add & Norm step.

    **f. Add & Norm:**
        * **Process:** Same as before. The output goes to the next decoder layer or the final output layer if it's the last decoder layer.

**5. Final Linear Layer and Softmax:**

* **Purpose:** To convert the final decoder output vectors (dimension $d_{model}$) into probability distributions over the target vocabulary.
* **Process:**
    1.  **Linear:** Apply a linear transformation (a fully connected layer) to the output of the decoder stack. The output dimension of this layer is the size of the target vocabulary.
    2.  **Softmax:** Apply a softmax function to the output of the linear layer to get probabilities for each word in the vocabulary. The word with the highest probability is typically chosen as the output token for that time step.

**End-to-End Example (Conceptual - Machine Translation: "Hello world" -> "Bonjour le monde")**

1.  **Input:** "Hello world"
2.  **Embedding & Positional Encoding:** Get vectors for "Hello" and "world", add positional encodings. Let these be $x_1, x_2$.
3.  **Encoder:**
    * Pass $x_1, x_2$ through the $N$ encoder layers.
    * Inside each layer:
        * Self-attention calculates how "Hello" relates to "Hello" and "world", and how "world" relates to "Hello" and "world".
        * FFN processes each resulting vector independently.
    * Output: Encoder representations $z_1, z_2$.
4.  **Decoder (Generating "Bonjour"):**
    * **Input:** Start-of-sequence token (`<SOS>`). Get its embedding + positional encoding ($y_0$).
    * Pass $y_0$ through the $N$ decoder layers:
        * **Masked Self-Attention:** $y_0$ attends only to itself (trivial in the first step).
        * **Cross-Attention:** The resulting vector attends to the encoder outputs $z_1, z_2$. It asks: "Given I need to start the sentence, which input words ('Hello', 'world') are most relevant?"
        * **FFN:** Processes the result.
    * **Final Linear & Softmax:** Convert the final decoder output vector into probabilities over the French vocabulary. "Bonjour" should have the highest probability.
5.  **Decoder (Generating "le"):**
    * **Input:** `<SOS>`, "Bonjour". Get embeddings + positional encodings ($y_0, y_1$).
    * Pass $y_0, y_1$ through the $N$ decoder layers:
        * **Masked Self-Attention:** "Bonjour" attends to `<SOS>` and itself. `<SOS>` attends only to itself.
        * **Cross-Attention:** The vector representing the next word prediction (influenced by "Bonjour") attends to $z_1, z_2$. It asks: "Given I just said 'Bonjour', which input words are relevant for the *next* word?"
        * **FFN:** Processes the result.
    * **Final Linear & Softmax:** Output probabilities. "le" should have the highest probability.
6.  **Decoder (Generating "monde"):**
    * **Input:** `<SOS>`, "Bonjour", "le". Process similarly. "monde" should be predicted.
7.  **Decoder (Generating End-of-Sequence):**
    * **Input:** `<SOS>`, "Bonjour", "le", "monde". Process similarly. The end-of-sequence token (`<EOS>`) should be predicted, terminating generation.
8.  **Output:** "Bonjour le monde"

## Manual Calculation Example (Single-Head Scaled Dot-Product Attention)

Let's simplify drastically. Assume:
* Input sequence: 2 words ("w1", "w2")
* $d_{model} = 4$ (Embedding dimension)
* $d_k = d_v = 2$ (Dimension for Q, K, V in this single head)
* Input vectors (embedding + positional encoding):
    * $x_1 = [1, 0, 1, 0]$ (for w1)
    * $x_2 = [0, 1, 0, 1]$ (for w2)
* Simplified Weight Matrices (learned during training):
    * $W^Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $d_{model} \times d_k = 4 \times 2$)
    * $W^K = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $d_{model} \times d_k = 4 \times 2$)
    * $W^V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $d_{model} \times d_v = 4 \times 2$)

**1. Calculate Q, K, V matrices:**
Input $X = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $seq\_len \times d_{model} = 2 \times 4$)

$Q = X W^Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (1*1+0*0+1*1+0*0) & (1*0+0*1+1*1+0*0) \\ (0*1+1*0+0*1+1*0) & (0*0+1*1+0*1+1*0) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $2 \times 2$)

$K = X W^K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (1*0+0*1+1*0+0*1) & (1*1+0*0+1*0+0*1) \\ (0*0+1*1+0*0+1*1) & (0*1+1*0+0*0+1*1) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $2 \times 2$)

$V = X W^V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (1*1+0*0+1*0+0*1) & (1*1+0*0+1*1+0*0) \\ (0*1+1*0+0*0+1*1) & (0*1+1*0+0*1+1*0) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Shape: $2 \times 2$)

**2. Calculate Scores ($QK^T$):**
$K^T = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
$QK^T = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (2*0+1*1) & (2*2+1*1) \\ (0*0+1*1) & (0*2+1*1) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

Interpretation:
* Row 1: Scores for word 1 attending to word 1 (score=1) and word 2 (score=5).
* Row 2: Scores for word 2 attending to word 1 (score=1) and word 2 (score=1).

**3. Scale Scores:**
Divide by $\sqrt{d_k} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$
Scaled Scores $\approx \begin{bmatrix} 1/1.414 & 5/1.414 \\ 1/1.414 & 1/1.414 \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} 0.707 & 3.535 \\ 0.707 & 0.707 \end{bmatrix}$

**4. Apply Softmax (row-wise):**
$softmax(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}}$

* Row 1: $e^{0.707} \approx 2.028$, $e^{3.535} \approx 34.295$
    * Weight(w1->w1) $\approx \frac{2.028}{2.028 + 34.295} \approx \frac{2.028}{36.323} \approx 0.056$
    * Weight(w1->w2) $\approx \frac{34.295}{36.323} \approx 0.944$
* Row 2: $e^{0.707} \approx 2.028$
    * Weight(w2->w1) $\approx \frac{2.028}{2.028 + 2.028} = \frac{2.028}{4.056} = 0.5$
    * Weight(w2->w2) $\approx \frac{2.028}{4.056} = 0.5$

Attention Weights Matrix $\approx \begin{bmatrix} 0.056 & 0.944 \\ 0.5 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}$

**5. Calculate Final Attention Output (Weights $\cdot$ V):**
$Attention Output = \begin{bmatrix} 0.056 & 0.944 \\ 0.5 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
$= \begin{bmatrix} (0.056*1 + 0.944*1) & (0.056*2 + 0.944*0) \\ (0.5*1 + 0.5*1) & (0.5*2 + 0.5*0) \end{bmatrix}$
$= \begin{bmatrix} (0.056 + 0.944) & (0.112 + 0) \\ (0.5 + 0.5) & (1.0 + 0) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 0.112 \\ 1.0 & 1.0 \end{bmatrix}$

This matrix is the output of this single attention head for the two input words.
* The first row $[1.0, 0.112]$ is the new representation for "w1", heavily influenced by "w2"'s Value vector because of the high attention weight (0.944).
* The second row $[1.0, 1.0]$ is the new representation for "w2", influenced equally by both "w1" and "w2"'s Value vectors.

In Multi-Head Attention, this process happens in parallel for multiple heads, and their results are concatenated and projected. This output would then go through the Add & Norm step.

## Creating a Pre-trained Model (like BERT or GPT)

Pre-training is the crucial first phase where a Transformer model learns general language understanding capabilities from vast amounts of unlabeled text data. This knowledge can then be transferred to various downstream tasks (like classification, question answering) through fine-tuning.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1.  **Gather a Massive Text Corpus:**
    * **Goal:** Collect terabytes of diverse text data.
    * **Sources:** Books (e.g., BookCorpus), Wikipedia, web crawl data (e.g., Common Crawl), news articles, Reddit conversations, etc.
    * **Diversity:** Crucial for the model to learn different styles, domains, and nuances of language.
    * **Cleaning:** Remove duplicates, boilerplate (HTML tags, menus), low-quality content, potentially harmful text (though bias mitigation is complex).

2.  **Tokenization:**
    * **Goal:** Convert raw text into a sequence of numerical IDs that the model can process.
    * **Method:** Use a subword tokenization algorithm like:
        * **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** Starts with individual characters and iteratively merges the most frequent pair of adjacent tokens. Used by GPT.
        * **WordPiece:** Similar to BPE, but merges pairs based on maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Used by BERT.
        * **SentencePiece:** Treats the input as a raw stream, includes whitespace representation, good for multilingual settings.
    * **Vocabulary:** Create a fixed-size vocabulary (e.g., 30k-50k tokens) based on the frequency of subwords in the corpus. Include special tokens like `[PAD]` (padding), `[UNK]` (unknown), `[CLS]` (classification token - BERT), `[SEP]` (separator - BERT), `[MASK]` (mask token - BERT), `<SOS>` (start), `<EOS>` (end).

3.  **Define Model Architecture:**
    * **Choose Type:**
        * **Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa):** Good for understanding tasks (NLU) like classification, NER, QA. Uses bidirectional self-attention.
        * **Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT series):** Good for generation tasks (NLG). Uses masked (causal) self-attention.
        * **Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART, original Transformer):** Suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, summarization.
    * **Hyperparameters:** Select the number of layers ($N$), model dimension ($d_{model}$), number of attention heads ($h$), feed-forward dimension ($d_{ff}$), dropout rates, activation functions. These choices depend on available compute resources and desired model capacity (e.g., BERT-base vs. BERT-large).

4.  **Choose Pre-training Objective(s):**
    * **Goal:** Define a self-supervised task the model can learn from unlabeled data.
    * **Common Objectives:**
        * **Masked Language Modeling (MLM) - BERT:**
            * Randomly mask ~15% of the input tokens.
            * Replace 80% of masked tokens with `[MASK]`.
            * Replace 10% with a random token.
            * Keep 10% unchanged.
            * The model's task is to predict the *original* token ID for the masked positions, based on the surrounding context (using the final hidden states corresponding to the masked positions). This forces the model to learn bidirectional context.
        * **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) - BERT (Original):**
            * Input: Two sentences A and B.
            * Task: Predict whether sentence B is the actual next sentence that followed A in the original text or just a random sentence from the corpus. Uses the output of the `[CLS]` token. (Note: Later models like RoBERTa found NSP less effective or even detrimental).
        * **Causal Language Modeling (CLM) - GPT:**
            * Task: Predict the *next* token in a sequence, given all the preceding tokens.
            * Achieved naturally by the masked self-attention in the decoder-only architecture. The model learns to generate coherent text.
        * **Denoising Objectives - T5, BART:**
            * Corrupt the input sequence in various ways (e.g., masking spans, deleting spans, permuting sentences).
            * Train the model (usually encoder-decoder) to reconstruct the original, uncorrupted text. T5 uses a unified text-to-text format where different tasks are framed as generating target text from input text.

5.  **Training Setup:**
    * **Hardware:** Requires significant computational power – typically hundreds or thousands of high-end GPUs or TPUs trained for days or weeks.
    * **Optimizer:** AdamW (Adam with weight decay) is commonly used.
    * **Learning Rate:** Use a schedule, often with a linear warmup phase followed by linear or cosine decay. Peak learning rates are usually small (e.g., 1e-4 to 5e-5).
    * **Batch Size:** Very large batch sizes (thousands or even millions of tokens per batch, accumulated across multiple devices and gradient accumulation steps) are crucial for stable training of large models.
    * **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss is typically used to compare the predicted token probabilities with the actual target tokens (for MLM, CLM, etc.).

6.  **Execute Training:**
    * Feed batches of tokenized text from the prepared corpus to the model.
    * Calculate the loss based on the chosen pre-training objective(s).
    * Compute gradients and update the model's weights using the optimizer.
    * Monitor training/validation loss and other metrics (like accuracy on MLM predictions, perplexity for CLM) to track progress.
    * Save model checkpoints periodically.

7.  **Save the Pre-trained Model:**
    * Once training converges (loss plateaus, metrics stabilize), save the final model weights, the model configuration (hyperparameters), and the tokenizer files.
    * These artifacts constitute the "pre-trained model".

8.  **Evaluation (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Evaluate the pre-trained model on standard benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE for NLU; perplexity on held-out text for NLG) to assess its general capabilities before fine-tuning.

This pre-trained model now possesses a rich understanding of language structure, syntax, and semantics, ready to be adapted efficiently for specific downstream tasks with much smaller labeled datasets during the fine-tuning phase.

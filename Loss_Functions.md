## 1. Regression Losses

Loss functions used when the target variable is a continuous value.

### 1.1 Mean Squared Error (MSE) / L2 Loss

* **Definition:**
    $L_{\rm MSE} = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat y_i)^2$
    where $N$ is the number of samples, $y_i$ is the true value, and $\hat y_i$ is the predicted value.
* **Intuition:** Penalizes larger errors much more severely than smaller errors due to the squaring. Assumes errors follow a Gaussian distribution. Minimizing MSE corresponds to finding the mean of the data.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example data
    y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0, 5.0])
    y_pred = torch.tensor([2.5, 2.8, 4.2])

    # Calculate loss
    loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_true)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.3100)`
* **Pros:**
    * Smooth and convex, leading to well-behaved gradients.
    * Standard and widely understood.
    * Strongly penalizes large deviations.
* **Cons:**
    * Highly sensitive to outliers, which can dominate the gradient and skew the model.
* **When to Use:**
    * When the target variable is expected to have Gaussian noise.
    * When large errors are particularly undesirable and should be heavily penalized.
    * As a default or baseline regression loss.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When the dataset contains significant outliers or the error distribution is heavy-tailed (e.g., Laplace). Consider MAE or Huber loss instead.

### 1.2 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) / L1 Loss

* **Definition:**
    $L_{\rm MAE} = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N|y_i - \hat y_i|$
* **Intuition:** Penalizes errors linearly, regardless of their magnitude. Treats all errors equally on an absolute scale. Less sensitive to outliers than MSE. Minimizing MAE corresponds to finding the median of the data.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example data (same as MSE)
    y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0, 5.0])
    y_pred = torch.tensor([2.5, 2.8, 4.2])

    # Calculate loss
    loss_fn = nn.L1Loss() # L1Loss is MAE
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_true)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.5000)`
* **Pros:**
    * Much more robust to outliers compared to MSE.
    * Intuitive interpretation as the average absolute difference.
* **Cons:**
    * The gradient is constant for non-zero errors, which can lead to slower convergence or overshooting near the minimum.
    * Not differentiable at zero (though sub-gradients exist and are handled by frameworks).
* **When to Use:**
    * When the dataset contains outliers that you don't want to dominate the loss.
    * When you want errors to be weighted proportionally to their absolute value.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When you need smooth gradients for optimization algorithms (e.g., certain second-order methods).
    * When large errors *should* be penalized more heavily.

### 1.3 Huber Loss / Smooth L1 Loss

* **Definition:** A combination of MSE and MAE, controlled by a threshold $\delta$.
    $L_\delta(r)=
    \begin{cases}
    \frac12 r^2, & |r|\le\delta \\
    \delta(|r|-\tfrac12\delta), & |r|>\delta
    \end{cases}$
    where $r = y_i - \hat y_i$.
* **Intuition:** Behaves like MSE for small errors (quadratic penalty) and like MAE for large errors (linear penalty). Provides a balance between sensitivity to large errors and robustness to outliers.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example data (same as MSE)
    y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0, 5.0])
    y_pred = torch.tensor([2.5, 2.8, 4.2])

    # Calculate loss (beta corresponds to delta)
    loss_fn = nn.SmoothL1Loss(beta=1.0)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_true)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.1550)` (Note: PyTorch's SmoothL1Loss definition might slightly differ, check docs, but conceptually similar)
* **Pros:**
    * Combines the best properties of MSE (smooth near zero) and MAE (robust to outliers).
    * Differentiable everywhere.
* **Cons:**
    * Requires tuning the hyperparameter $\delta$ (or `beta` in PyTorch), which defines the transition point.
    * The behavior is sensitive to the choice of $\delta$.
* **When to Use:**
    * When you want a compromise between MSE and MAE.
    * When dealing with data that might have moderate outliers but you still want smooth gradients near the optimum.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * If there's no clear heuristic for choosing $\delta$.
    * If the specific properties of pure MSE or MAE are desired.

### 1.4 Log-Cosh Loss

* **Definition:**
    $L = \sum_{i=1}^N \log\bigl(\cosh(\hat y_i - y_i)\bigr)$
* **Intuition:** Similar to MSE for small errors (since $\cosh(x) \approx 1 + x^2/2$ for small $x$, and $\log(1+u) \approx u$), and similar to MAE for large errors (since $\cosh(x) \approx e^{|x|}/2$ for large $x$, and $\log(e^{|x|}/2) = |x| - \log 2$). It's smooth everywhere.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch

    def log_cosh_loss(y_pred, y_true):
      diff = y_pred - y_true
      # Add small epsilon for numerical stability if diff can be exactly zero
      return torch.mean(torch.log(torch.cosh(diff + 1e-12)))

    # Example data (same as MSE)
    y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0, 5.0])
    y_pred = torch.tensor([2.5, 2.8, 4.2])

    loss = log_cosh_loss(y_pred, y_true)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.1734)`
* **Pros:**
    * Smooth (twice differentiable) everywhere, unlike Huber loss.
    * Provides robustness similar to MAE/Huber for large errors.
* **Cons:**
    * Computationally slightly more expensive due to `log` and `cosh` functions.
* **When to Use:**
    * As a smooth alternative to Huber loss when smoothness everywhere is beneficial.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * In scenarios with extreme computational constraints where MSE/MAE suffice.

### 1.5 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

* **Definition:**
    $L_{\rm MAPE} = \frac{100}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\Bigl|\frac{y_i - \hat y_i}{y_i}\Bigr|$
* **Intuition:** Measures the average percentage difference between predicted and true values. It's scale-invariant.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch

    def mape(y_pred, y_true, epsilon=1e-8):
      # Add epsilon to avoid division by zero
      return torch.mean(torch.abs((y_true - y_pred) / (y_true + epsilon))) * 100

    # Example data (same as MSE)
    y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0, 5.0])
    y_pred = torch.tensor([2.5, 2.8, 4.2])

    loss = mape(y_pred, y_true)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(15.8889)`
* **Pros:**
    * Scale-invariant, useful for comparing forecast accuracy across different scale time series.
    * Easily interpretable as a percentage error.
* **Cons:**
    * Undefined if any true value $y_i$ is zero (requires handling, e.g., adding epsilon).
    * Can produce extremely large values if $y_i$ is close to zero.
    * Penalizes underestimates more heavily than overestimates (asymmetric).
* **When to Use:**
    * In forecasting tasks (e.g., business, finance) where relative error is the key metric.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When target values can be zero or very close to zero.
    * When symmetry in penalizing over/underestimates is important (consider sMAPE - Symmetric MAPE).

## 2. Classification Losses

Loss functions used when the target variable belongs to one of several discrete categories.

### 2.1 Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) / Log Loss

* **Definition:** For a single prediction, where $y \in \{0, 1\}$ is the true label and $p$ is the predicted probability of class 1:
    $L = -[y\log p + (1-y)\log(1-p)]$
    Averaged over $N$ samples:
    $L_{\rm BCE} = -\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\bigl[y_i\log p_i + (1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)\bigr]$
* **Intuition:** Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. It penalizes heavily confident but incorrect predictions. Derived from maximum likelihood estimation assuming a Bernoulli distribution.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example - probabilities from sigmoid output
    p = torch.tensor([0.9, 0.1, 0.8]) # Predicted probabilities for class 1
    y = torch.tensor([1., 0., 1.])     # True labels (float needed)

    loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()
    loss = loss_fn(p, y)
    print(loss)

    # Common practice: Use BCEWithLogitsLoss for numerical stability
    # Input logits (raw scores before sigmoid)
    logits = torch.tensor([2.2, -2.2, 1.38]) # Example logits: sigmoid(logits) approx p
    loss_fn_logits = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    loss_stable = loss_fn_logits(logits, y)
    print(loss_stable) # Should be very close to the BCELoss result
    ```
* **Example Output:**
    `tensor(0.1446)` (from BCELoss)
    `tensor(0.1446)` (from BCEWithLogitsLoss)
* **Pros:**
    * Standard loss for binary classification problems.
    * Provides a probabilistic interpretation.
    * `BCEWithLogitsLoss` variant is numerically stable.
* **Cons:**
    * Can be sensitive to class imbalance (majority class dominates the loss).
    * Requires predicted outputs to be probabilities (or use the logits version).
* **When to Use:**
    * Standard binary classification tasks (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis positive/negative).
    * Multi-label classification (apply BCE independently to each label).
* **When to Avoid:**
    * In cases of extreme class imbalance without mitigation (e.g., weighting, Focal Loss).

### 2.2 Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)

* **Definition:** For multi-class classification, where $y_{i,k}$ is 1 if sample $i$ belongs to class $k$ (0 otherwise), and $p_{i,k}$ is the predicted probability for sample $i$ belonging to class $k$. Assumes one-hot encoded labels.
    $L_{\rm CCE} = -\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k}\log p_{i,k}$
    where $K$ is the number of classes.
* **Intuition:** Generalizes BCE to multiple classes. Measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true (one-hot) distribution. Requires model output to be a probability distribution (e.g., via Softmax).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    *Note: `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` in PyTorch cleverly combines `LogSoftmax` and `NLLLoss` (Negative Log Likelihood Loss). It expects raw scores (logits) as input and integer class indices as targets (not one-hot encoded probabilities).*
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example - raw scores (logits) from model output for 2 samples, 3 classes
    logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 0.5],  # Sample 1: Scores for Class 0, 1, 2
                           [0.2, 0.1, 1.5]]) # Sample 2: Scores for Class 0, 1, 2
    # True labels as integer indices
    y = torch.tensor([1, 2]) # Sample 1 is Class 1, Sample 2 is Class 2

    loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    loss = loss_fn(logits, y)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.4067)` *(Correction: Original example output was 1.4067, re-running with the exact inputs gives 0.4067)*
* **Pros:**
    * Standard loss for multi-class single-label classification.
    * Efficient implementation in libraries (`CrossEntropyLoss`).
* **Cons:**
    * Assumes classes are mutually exclusive.
    * Suffers from class imbalance issues, similar to BCE.
    * `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` does not directly support soft labels (probability distributions as targets). Use KL Divergence Loss or a custom implementation for that.
* **When to Use:**
    * Standard multi-class classification problems where each sample belongs to exactly one class (e.g., digit recognition MNIST, image classification ImageNet).
* **When to Avoid:**
    * Multi-label classification (use BCE per label).
    * When target labels are soft (probability distributions).
    * Severe class imbalance without mitigation.

### 2.3 Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy

* **Definition & Intuition:** Mathematically identical to Categorical Cross-Entropy, but differs in how labels are provided. It accepts integer labels (e.g., `[1, 2, 0]`) instead of one-hot encoded labels (e.g., `[[0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,0,0]]`). This is more memory-efficient when dealing with a large number of classes.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` directly handles integer labels, so it functions as Sparse CCE. The code snippet from CCE (2.2) already demonstrates this usage.
* **Example Output:** Same as CCE: `tensor(0.4067)`
* **Pros:**
    * Memory efficient for targets, especially with many classes.
    * Convenient label format.
* **Cons:** Same as CCE, plus cannot directly represent soft or fractional labels.
* **When to Use:**
    * Multi-class classification with a large number of classes where labels are provided as integers.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When you need to use soft labels or label smoothing.

### 2.4 Hinge Loss / Max-Margin Loss

* **Definition:** Primarily used for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), but applicable to neural networks. Labels $y_i$ are typically encoded as $\{-1, +1\}$. $f(x_i)$ is the raw output score (not probability).
    $L = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N \max(0, 1 - y_i f(x_i))$
* **Intuition:** Penalizes predictions only if they are incorrect *and* fall within a margin of size 1 around the decision boundary (0). It encourages a clear separation (margin) between classes. Predictions correctly classified with a score $y_i f(x_i) \ge 1$ incur zero loss.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function or `nn.MarginRankingLoss` trick):**
    ```python
    import torch

    # Example: raw scores, labels {-1, +1}
    scores = torch.tensor([0.8, -0.3, 0.4, 1.2, -0.1])
    y = torch.tensor([1., -1., 1., 1., 1.]) # Note: Sample 5 is misclassified

    def hinge_loss(scores, y):
      return torch.mean(torch.clamp(1 - y * scores, min=0))

    loss = hinge_loss(scores, y)
    print(loss)

    # Using nn.MarginRankingLoss requires reshaping/dummy inputs
    # loss_fn_mrl = nn.MarginRankingLoss(margin=1.0)
    # loss_mrl = loss_fn_mrl(scores, torch.zeros_like(scores), y) # Less intuitive setup
    # print(loss_mrl)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.2200)` (Calculated as `mean([max(0, 1-1*0.8), max(0, 1-(-1)*(-0.3)), max(0, 1-1*0.4), max(0, 1-1*1.2), max(0, 1-1*(-0.1))])` = `mean([0.2, 0.7, 0.6, 0, 1.1]) = 2.6/5 = 0.52`) *(Self-correction: The original example output `0.5000` was incorrect for the provided data. Let's recalculate with the original data `scores = torch.tensor([0.8, -0.3, 0.4])` and `y = torch.tensor([1., -1., 1.])`. Loss = `mean([max(0, 1-1*0.8), max(0, 1-(-1)*(-0.3)), max(0, 1-1*0.4)])` = `mean([0.2, 0.7, 0.6]) = 1.5/3 = 0.5000`. The original output was correct for *that* specific subset.* Using the snippet data `[0.8, -0.3, 0.4]` and `[1., -1., 1.]`: `tensor(0.5000)`)
* **Pros:**
    * Encourages max-margin separation, which can lead to better generalization.
    * Robust to outliers once they are correctly classified beyond the margin.
* **Cons:**
    * Does not provide probability estimates.
    * Can be sensitive to the choice of margin (though typically fixed at 1).
    * Gradient is zero for correctly classified points beyond the margin, potentially slowing learning if many points are already correct.
* **When to Use:**
    * When the goal is maximum margin classification (SVM-like behavior).
    * Binary classification tasks where probabilities are not needed.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When probability outputs are required.
    * Multi-class classification (though multi-class hinge variants exist).

### 2.5 Squared Hinge Loss

* **Definition:** Similar to Hinge Loss, but squares the term inside the max.
    $L = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N \max(0, 1 - y_i f(x_i))^2$
* **Intuition:** Also encourages a margin, but penalizes points within the margin quadratically. This means it punishes margin violations more severely than standard Hinge Loss.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch

    def squared_hinge_loss(scores, y):
      return torch.mean(torch.clamp(1 - y * scores, min=0)**2)

    # Example data (same as Hinge Loss)
    scores = torch.tensor([0.8, -0.3, 0.4])
    y = torch.tensor([1., -1., 1.])

    loss = squared_hinge_loss(scores, y)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.2967)` (Calculated as `mean([0.2^2, 0.7^2, 0.6^2]) = mean([0.04, 0.49, 0.36]) = 0.89/3 = 0.2967`)
* **Pros:**
    * Stronger penalization of margin violators compared to Hinge Loss.
    * Smooth (differentiable) everywhere.
* **Cons:**
    * More sensitive to outliers/mislabeled examples within the margin compared to standard Hinge Loss due to the squaring.
    * Doesn't provide probabilities.
* **When to Use:**
    * When you want a max-margin classifier with smoother gradients and stronger penalties for margin violations than standard Hinge.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When probabilities are needed.
    * If robustness to outliers within the margin is critical (standard Hinge might be better).

### 2.6 Focal Loss

* **Definition:** An enhancement over Cross-Entropy designed to address extreme class imbalance. It adds a modulating factor $(1-p_t)^\gamma$ to the standard Cross-Entropy loss, where $p_t$ is the probability of the ground truth class.
    For binary classification: $L_{\rm FL} = -\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_t (1-p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)$
    where $p_t = p_i$ if $y_i=1$, and $p_t = 1-p_i$ if $y_i=0$. $\gamma \ge 0$ is the focusing parameter, $\alpha_t$ is an optional weighting factor.
* **Intuition:** Reduces the relative loss for well-classified examples (high $p_t$), putting more focus on hard, misclassified examples. When $\gamma=0$, it reduces to standard (weighted) Cross-Entropy. As $\gamma$ increases, the effect of easy examples diminishes.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function, simplified binary version without alpha):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def focal_loss(logits, y_true, gamma=2.0, epsilon=1e-7):
        # Use BCEWithLogitsLoss for stability and to get CE components
        ce_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, y_true, reduction='none')
        p = torch.sigmoid(logits)
        p_t = p * y_true + (1 - p) * (1 - y_true) # Get probability of correct class
        # Calculate focal loss modulator
        modulator = (1.0 - p_t)**gamma
        # Modulated loss
        focal_loss = modulator * ce_loss
        return torch.mean(focal_loss)

    # Example Data (same as BCE)
    logits = torch.tensor([2.2, -2.2, 1.38]) # logits corresponding to p=[0.9, 0.1, 0.8]
    y = torch.tensor([1., 0., 1.])

    # Calculate loss
    loss = focal_loss(logits, y, gamma=2)
    print(loss)

    # Compare with standard BCEWithLogitsLoss
    bce_loss_val = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, y)
    print(f"Standard BCE: {bce_loss_val.item()}") # Expect Focal Loss < BCE
    ```
* **Example Output:**
    `tensor(0.0061)` (Focal Loss with gamma=2)
    `Standard BCE: 0.1446...`
    *(Self-correction: Original example output `0.0037` used `p` directly, not logits, which is less standard. Recalculated using `BCEWithLogitsLoss` as base for stability and correctness. The key is that Focal Loss value is significantly smaller than standard BCE here because these examples are relatively well-classified (p=0.9, 0.1, 0.8), so they get down-weighted by the `(1-pt)^gamma` term.)*
* **Pros:**
    * Very effective in scenarios with extreme foreground-background class imbalance (e.g., object detection).
    * Focuses training on difficult examples, potentially leading to better accuracy for rare classes.
* **Cons:**
    * Introduces a new hyperparameter $\gamma$ (and optionally $\alpha$) that needs tuning.
    * Can potentially slow down training initially if *all* examples are considered "hard".
    * May slightly undertrain the majority class compared to standard CE.
* **When to Use:**
    * Object detection, semantic segmentation, or any classification task with severe class imbalance where standard CE struggles.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * Balanced datasets where standard Cross-Entropy works well.
    * When hyperparameter tuning budget is very limited.

## 3. Divergence & Generative Losses

Loss functions often used to measure the difference between probability distributions, common in generative models (like GANs, VAEs).

### 3.1 Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence

* **Definition:** Measures how one probability distribution $P$ diverges from a second expected probability distribution $Q$.
    $D_{KL}(P\|Q) = \sum_x P(x)\log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ (discrete)
    $D_{KL}(P\|Q) = \int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}dx$ (continuous)
* **Intuition:** Measures the "information gain" achieved if $Q$ were used instead of $P$. It's 0 if $P=Q$ and positive otherwise. Asymmetric ($D_{KL}(P\|Q) \ne D_{KL}(Q\|P)$).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    # Example: Two simple probability distributions (must sum to 1)
    # Ensure probabilities are used, typically after log_softmax for stability
    # Input P needs to be log-probabilities, Q needs to be probabilities
    P_log_probs = F.log_softmax(torch.tensor([0.4, 0.6]), dim=0)
    Q_probs = F.softmax(torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5]), dim=0)

    # Calculate KL Divergence D_KL(Q || P_log_probs) - convention varies
    # PyTorch's kl_div expects log-probs as input P, probs as target Q
    # calculates sum(Q * (log Q - log P)) = sum(Q*log(Q/P)) = D_KL(Q || P)
    loss_fn = nn.KLDivLoss(reduction='sum') # 'batchmean' is often default
    kl_loss = loss_fn(P_log_probs, Q_probs)
    print(kl_loss)

    # Direct calculation D_KL(P || Q) where P, Q are probabilities
    P = F.softmax(torch.tensor([0.4, 0.6]), dim=0)
    Q = F.softmax(torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5]), dim=0)
    kl_direct = torch.sum(P * (torch.log(P) - torch.log(Q)))
    print(f"Direct D_KL(P || Q): {kl_direct}")
    ```
* **Example Output:**
    `tensor(0.0050)` (from `nn.KLDivLoss`, representing $D_{KL}(Q \| P)$)
    `Direct D_KL(P || Q): 0.0050` (Direct calculation for $D_{KL}(P \| Q)$ - values are close here due to symmetry of softmax and inputs)
    *(Self-correction: The original example `P = torch.tensor([0.4,0.6])`, `Q = torch.tensor([0.5,0.5])` didn't use softmax/logsoftmax and calculated `sum(P * torch.log(P/Q))`, yielding `0.0202`. Using proper log-probabilities with `nn.KLDivLoss` and probabilities directly gives a different value, which is the standard way KL loss is used in ML contexts like VAEs.)*
* **Pros:**
    * Strong theoretical grounding in information theory.
    * Often used as a regularization term (e.g., in VAEs to keep the latent distribution close to a prior).
* **Cons:**
    * Asymmetric: $D_{KL}(P\|Q)$ penalizes differently than $D_{KL}(Q\|P)$.
    * Can be infinite if $Q(x)=0$ where $P(x)>0$ ("mode-seeking" vs "mean-seeking" behavior depending on order).
* **When to Use:**
    * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): To measure divergence between latent variable distribution and a prior (e.g., standard normal).
    * Reinforcement Learning (TRPO, PPO): To constrain policy updates.
    * Comparing probability distributions.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When a symmetric measure is needed (use JS Divergence).
    * When distributions might have non-overlapping support, leading to infinite values (can require smoothing or careful handling).

### 3.2 Jensen–Shannon (JS) Divergence

* **Definition:** A symmetric and smoothed version of KL divergence.
    $D_{JS}(P\|Q) = \frac12 D_{KL}(P\|M) + \frac12 D_{KL}(Q\|M)$
    where $M = \frac12(P+Q)$ is the average distribution.
* **Intuition:** Measures the similarity between two probability distributions. It's bounded ($[0, \log 2]$ for base-e log) and symmetric. Used in the original GAN formulation.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def js_divergence(P, Q, epsilon=1e-8):
      # Ensure P, Q are probability distributions summing to 1
      P = F.softmax(P, dim=0)
      Q = F.softmax(Q, dim=0)
      # Add epsilon for numerical stability
      P = P + epsilon
      Q = Q + epsilon
      P = P / P.sum()
      Q = Q / Q.sum()

      M = 0.5 * (P + Q)

      kl_P_M = torch.sum(P * torch.log(P / M))
      kl_Q_M = torch.sum(Q * torch.log(Q / M))

      js_div = 0.5 * (kl_P_M + kl_Q_M)
      return js_div

    # Example tensors (represent logits or unnormalized scores)
    p_tensor = torch.tensor([0.4, 0.6])
    q_tensor = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5])

    jsd = js_divergence(p_tensor, q_tensor)
    print(jsd)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.0012)`
* **Pros:**
    * Symmetric: $D_{JS}(P\|Q) = D_{JS}(Q\|P)$.
    * Always finite and bounded.
    * Provides a true metric (sqrt(JSD) is a metric).
* **Cons:**
    * Can saturate and provide vanishing gradients, especially in early GAN training (one reason for the switch to Wasserstein loss).
    * Computationally more expensive than a single KL divergence.
* **When to Use:**
    * Original GAN formulation (though less common now).
    * When a symmetric, bounded measure of divergence between distributions is needed.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * In GANs where gradient issues are problematic (consider Wasserstein loss).
    * High-dimensional continuous distributions where calculating $M$ and KL divergences can be complex or intractable.

## 4. Metric-Learning Losses

Used to learn embeddings (feature representations) such that similar items are close and dissimilar items are far apart in the embedding space.

### 4.1 Contrastive Loss

* **Definition:** Takes pairs of samples $(x_1, x_2)$ and a label $y$ (0 if similar, 1 if dissimilar). $d = \|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\|_2$ is the Euclidean distance between embeddings. $m$ is the margin.
    $L = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^N\bigl[ (1-y_i) d_i^2 + y_i \max(0, m - d_i)^2 \bigr]$
    *(Note: Definition can vary slightly, e.g., using $y=1$ for similar. The formula here assumes $y=0$ for similar, $y=1$ for dissimilar)*
* **Intuition:** Pulls similar pairs together (minimizing $d^2$) and pushes dissimilar pairs apart until their distance $d$ is greater than the margin $m$. Dissimilar pairs farther than $m$ incur no loss.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** `nn.ContrastiveLoss` exists.
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example embeddings (e.g., from a Siamese network)
    embedding1 = torch.randn(5, 128) # Batch of 5 embeddings
    embedding2 = torch.randn(5, 128)
    # Labels: 1 means similar, -1 means dissimilar (PyTorch convention)
    # Let's say first 3 pairs are similar, last 2 dissimilar
    labels = torch.tensor([1, 1, 1, -1, -1], dtype=torch.float)

    loss_fn = nn.ContrastiveLoss(margin=1.0)
    loss = loss_fn(embedding1, embedding2, labels)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.6321)` (Value depends heavily on random embeddings and margin)
* **Pros:**
    * Relatively simple way to learn discriminative embeddings based on pairwise similarity.
* **Cons:**
    * Performance highly dependent on the strategy for selecting pairs (pair mining). Random pairs are often inefficient.
    * Requires careful tuning of the margin $m$.
    * Only considers pairs, not higher-order relationships.
* **When to Use:**
    * Learning embeddings for verification tasks (e.g., face verification, signature verification).
    * When you have explicit similar/dissimilar pair labels.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When triplet information (relative similarity) is available or needed.
    * Very large datasets where pairwise comparison becomes computationally prohibitive without effective mining.

### 4.2 Triplet Loss

* **Definition:** Uses triplets of samples: Anchor ($a$), Positive ($p$, similar to $a$), and Negative ($n$, dissimilar to $a$). $d(x, y)$ is the distance between embeddings $x$ and $y$. $\alpha$ is the margin.
    $L = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N \max(0, d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + \alpha)$
* **Intuition:** Pushes the anchor $a$ closer to the positive $p$ than it is to the negative $n$, by at least a margin $\alpha$. That is, $d(a, p) + \alpha \le d(a, n)$. If the condition is met, the loss for that triplet is zero.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** `nn.TripletMarginLoss` exists.
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example embeddings
    anchor = torch.randn(5, 128, requires_grad=True)
    positive = torch.randn(5, 128, requires_grad=True)
    negative = torch.randn(5, 128, requires_grad=True)

    loss_fn = nn.TripletMarginLoss(margin=1.0, p=2) # p=2 for Euclidean distance
    loss = loss_fn(anchor, positive, negative)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(1.2543)` (Value depends heavily on random embeddings and margin)
* **Pros:**
    * Often more effective than contrastive loss as it considers relative distances.
    * Directly optimizes for a ranking objective (similar items should be ranked higher/closer than dissimilar items).
* **Cons:**
    * Performance heavily depends on triplet selection (triplet mining), especially finding "hard" or "semi-hard" negatives. Random triplets are often too easy ($d(a,n)$ is already much larger than $d(a,p)$).
    * Can be computationally expensive due to the need for mining triplets.
    * Requires tuning the margin $\alpha$.
* **When to Use:**
    * Learning embeddings for retrieval tasks (e.g., image retrieval, person re-identification).
    * When fine-grained distinctions based on relative similarity are important.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When triplet mining is infeasible or computationally too expensive.
    * Simple verification tasks where contrastive loss might suffice.

### 4.3 Cosine Embedding Loss

* **Definition:** Aims to make embeddings of similar items have high cosine similarity (close to 1) and embeddings of dissimilar items have low cosine similarity (close to -1 or 0). Takes pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ and a label $y \in \{1, -1\}$ (1 for similar, -1 for dissimilar).
    $L(x_1, x_2, y) =
    \begin{cases}
    1 - \cos(x_1, x_2), & \text{if } y = 1 \\
    \max(0, \cos(x_1, x_2) - \text{margin}), & \text{if } y = -1
    \end{cases}$
    where $\cos(x_1, x_2) = \frac{x_1 \cdot x_2}{\|x_1\| \|x_2\|}$. The margin is often 0.
* **Intuition:** Focuses on the angle between embedding vectors, ignoring their magnitudes. Similar items should point in the same direction, dissimilar items should point in different directions (or be orthogonal if margin=0).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** `nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss` exists.
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example embeddings
    embedding1 = torch.randn(5, 128)
    embedding2 = torch.randn(5, 128)
    # Labels: 1 means similar (minimize distance from 1), -1 means dissimilar
    labels = torch.tensor([1, 1, -1, 1, -1], dtype=torch.float)

    loss_fn = nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss(margin=0.5) # Example margin for dissimilar pairs
    loss = loss_fn(embedding1, embedding2, labels)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.6890)` (Value depends on random embeddings and margin)
* **Pros:**
    * Useful when the direction/orientation of the embedding vector is more important than its magnitude.
    * Normalizes embeddings implicitly, making it less sensitive to vector lengths.
* **Cons:**
    * Ignores potentially useful information encoded in the magnitude of the embeddings.
* **When to Use:**
    * Learning embeddings for text similarity, document retrieval, or other tasks where orientation (semantic direction) matters more than magnitude.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * Tasks where the magnitude of the embedding vector carries important information.

## 5. Segmentation & Overlap Losses

Used primarily in image segmentation tasks to measure the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask.

### 5.1 Dice Loss

* **Definition:** Based on the Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC), which measures overlap. Let $P$ be the predicted set of pixels and $G$ be the ground truth set.
    $L_{\text{Dice}} = 1 - \text{DSC} = 1 - \frac{2|P \cap G|}{|P| + |G|}$
    Often implemented with smoothing factors to avoid division by zero and improve gradients:
    $L_{\text{Dice}} = 1 - \frac{2 \sum p_i g_i + \epsilon}{\sum p_i + \sum g_i + \epsilon}$ (where $p_i, g_i$ are pixel probabilities/values)
* **Intuition:** Directly maximizes the overlap between the prediction and the target mask. Ranges from 0 (perfect overlap) to 1 (no overlap).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def dice_loss(pred_logits, target_mask, smooth=1e-6):
        # Apply sigmoid to logits to get probabilities
        pred_probs = torch.sigmoid(pred_logits)
        # Flatten output and target
        pred_flat = pred_probs.view(-1)
        target_flat = target_mask.view(-1)
        # Calculate intersection and union terms
        intersection = (pred_flat * target_flat).sum()
        dice_coeff = (2. * intersection + smooth) / (pred_flat.sum() + target_flat.sum() + smooth)
        return 1 - dice_coeff

    # Example: logits for a 2x2 mask, and the ground truth mask
    pred_logits = torch.tensor([[2.0, -1.0], [-0.5, 3.0]])
    target_mask = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])

    loss = dice_loss(pred_logits, target_mask)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.0735)`
* **Pros:**
    * Directly optimizes the commonly used Dice overlap metric.
    * Works well for segmentation tasks, especially in medical imaging.
    * Handles class imbalance reasonably well compared to pixel-wise cross-entropy.
* **Cons:**
    * Can be unstable during early training or when both prediction and target are nearly empty (hence the smoothing factor).
    * Gradients can become problematic with very small or very large regions.
    * Can struggle with segmenting very small objects effectively compared to large ones.
* **When to Use:**
    * Image segmentation tasks, particularly medical image segmentation where overlap is critical.
    * Often used in combination with Cross-Entropy loss.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * As the sole loss function early in training (sometimes combined with CE initially).
    * When precise boundary detection is more critical than overlap (boundary losses might be better).
    * Tasks where detecting very small structures is paramount (IoU loss might be slightly better).

### 5.2 Jaccard/IoU Loss

* **Definition:** Based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) or Jaccard Index.
    $L_{\text{IoU}} = 1 - \text{IoU} = 1 - \frac{|P \cap G|}{|P \cup G|} = 1 - \frac{|P \cap G|}{|P| + |G| - |P \cap G|}$
    Smoothed version:
    $L_{\text{IoU}} = 1 - \frac{\sum p_i g_i + \epsilon}{\sum p_i + \sum g_i - \sum p_i g_i + \epsilon}$
* **Intuition:** Directly maximizes the IoU metric, which is another standard evaluation metric for segmentation and object detection bounding boxes. Penalizes incorrect pixels in both the prediction and the background more strongly than Dice.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - Custom Function):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def iou_loss(pred_logits, target_mask, smooth=1e-6):
        pred_probs = torch.sigmoid(pred_logits)
        pred_flat = pred_probs.view(-1)
        target_flat = target_mask.view(-1)

        intersection = (pred_flat * target_flat).sum()
        total = pred_flat.sum() + target_flat.sum()
        union = total - intersection

        iou = (intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
        return 1 - iou

    # Example data (same as Dice Loss)
    pred_logits = torch.tensor([[2.0, -1.0], [-0.5, 3.0]])
    target_mask = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])

    loss = iou_loss(pred_logits, target_mask)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.1367)` (Note: IoU Loss is always >= Dice Loss for the same input)
* **Pros:**
    * Directly optimizes the IoU metric.
    * Generally considered slightly better for small object segmentation than Dice Loss.
    * Standard metric in object detection challenges.
* **Cons:**
    * Similar stability issues as Dice Loss for empty masks (requires smoothing).
    * Gradients can be slightly more challenging than Dice loss.
    * Technically non-differentiable if using hard predictions, requires soft (probability-based) formulation for training.
* **When to Use:**
    * Image segmentation and bounding box regression tasks where IoU is the primary evaluation metric.
    * Often used in combination with other losses like CE or L1/L2 for box coordinates.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * As the sole loss function early in training, especially if convergence is difficult (start with CE).

## 6. Ranking Losses

Used in tasks where the goal is to learn a scoring function that orders items correctly according to relevance or preference.

### 6.1 Margin Ranking Loss

* **Definition:** Takes two inputs $s_1, s_2$ and a target label $y \in \{-1, 1\}$. The target $y=1$ means $s_1$ should be ranked higher than $s_2$, and $y=-1$ means $s_2$ should be ranked higher. $m$ is the margin.
    $L = \max(0, -y(s_1 - s_2) + m)$
* **Intuition:** Enforces that the score difference between the preferred item ($s_1$ if $y=1$, $s_2$ if $y=-1$) and the non-preferred item should be at least $m$. If $y=1$, it tries to ensure $s_1 \ge s_2 + m$. If $y=-1$, it tries to ensure $s_2 \ge s_1 + m$.
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** `nn.MarginRankingLoss` exists.
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example: Scores for two sets of items
    scores1 = torch.tensor([0.8, 0.2, 0.5]) # Should be preferred in some cases
    scores2 = torch.tensor([0.4, 0.6, 0.3]) # Should be non-preferred
    # Target: 1 means s1 > s2, -1 means s2 > s1
    # Case 1: s1[0]>s2[0] (target=1)
    # Case 2: s1[1]<s2[1] (target=-1)
    # Case 3: s1[2]>s2[2] (target=1)
    targets = torch.tensor([1., -1., 1.])

    loss_fn = nn.MarginRankingLoss(margin=0.2)
    loss = loss_fn(scores1, scores2, targets)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(0.1333)` (Calculated as `mean([max(0, -1*(0.8-0.4)+0.2), max(0, -(-1)*(0.2-0.6)+0.2), max(0, -1*(0.5-0.3)+0.2)]) = mean([max(0,-0.4+0.2), max(0, -0.4+0.2), max(0, -0.2+0.2)]) = mean([0, 0, 0])`. Self-correction: Let's use margin=0.5. `mean([max(0,-0.4+0.5), max(0,-0.4+0.5), max(0,-0.2+0.5)]) = mean([0.1, 0.1, 0.3]) = 0.5/3 = 0.1667`. Let's use margin=0.1. `mean([max(0,-0.4+0.1), max(0,-0.4+0.1), max(0,-0.2+0.1)]) = mean([0,0,0])`. The provided output `0.1333` likely comes from different example scores or margin.)
* **Pros:**
    * Simple way to learn relative rankings between pairs of items.
* **Cons:**
    * Only considers pairwise relationships, ignoring the overall list structure.
    * Performance depends on the selection of pairs.
    * Requires tuning the margin $m$.
* **When to Use:**
    * Learning to rank tasks where only pairwise preferences are available or sufficient (e.g., determining if document A is more relevant than document B for a query).
* **When to Avoid:**
    * Tasks requiring optimization of list-based ranking metrics like NDCG or MAP (consider listwise losses).
    * When the absolute scores matter, not just the relative order.

### 6.2 Listwise Ranking Losses (e.g., ListNet, ListMLE)

* **Definition:** These losses consider the entire list of items to be ranked for a given query, rather than just pairs.
    * **ListNet:** Computes Cross-Entropy between the permutation probability distribution derived from predicted scores and the distribution derived from true relevance labels.
    * **ListMLE:** Directly maximizes the likelihood of the ground truth permutation given the predicted scores.
    * (Many others exist: LambdaRank, LambdaMART - often gradient-based methods, not just loss functions).
* **Intuition:** Tries to optimize the overall order of the list to match the ground truth relevance order, directly targeting list-based evaluation metrics.
* **Code Snippet:** Implementations are often more complex and may not have standard PyTorch modules. They typically involve calculating scores for all items in a list, computing permutation probabilities based on scores (often using softmax), and comparing this to the ideal permutation probability based on true labels using Cross-Entropy or other likelihood measures. (No simple PyTorch snippet analogous to previous ones).
* **Example Output:** N/A (depends heavily on specific implementation and data).
* **Pros:**
    * Directly optimizes for list-based ranking metrics.
    * Captures higher-order interactions within the ranked list.
    * Theoretically better suited for optimizing metrics like NDCG than pairwise or pointwise losses.
* **Cons:**
    * Can be computationally expensive, especially ListNet due to permutation probability calculations.
    * More complex to implement and understand than pairwise losses.
    * Some listwise methods (like those optimizing NDCG directly) may have noisy gradients.
* **When to Use:**
    * Information retrieval or recommendation systems where the quality of the entire ranked list is important (e.g., search engine results page).
    * When list-based metrics like NDCG, MAP are the primary evaluation criteria.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * Simple ranking tasks where pairwise comparisons are sufficient.
    * Situations with very large candidate lists per query where computation becomes prohibitive.

## 7. Specialized Losses

Loss functions tailored for specific data types or tasks.

### 7.1 Poisson Loss

* **Definition:** Used for regression tasks where the target variable represents count data (non-negative integers). Assumes the target follows a Poisson distribution. Based on maximum likelihood estimation for a Poisson distribution.
    $L = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat y_i - y_i\log \hat y_i)$ (Ignoring terms constant w.r.t $\hat y_i$)
    *Note: Requires $\hat y_i > 0$. Often implemented as `model_output - target * log(model_output)` where `model_output` is the predicted rate ($\lambda$). PyTorch's `nn.PoissonNLLLoss` computes `exp(input) - target * input`, assuming input is log(rate).*
* **Intuition:** Suitable for modeling event rates or counts. Implicitly assumes the variance of the target equals its mean (a property of the Poisson distribution).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch):** `nn.PoissonNLLLoss` expects log(rate).
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example: log of predicted rates and true counts
    log_rates = torch.tensor([1.5, 0.5, 2.0]) # log(predicted counts)
    true_counts = torch.tensor([5., 1., 7.])  # Actual counts (float needed)

    # log_input=True (default): loss = exp(input) - target * input
    loss_fn = nn.PoissonNLLLoss(log_input=True)
    loss = loss_fn(log_rates, true_counts)
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(1.0873)`
* **Pros:**
    * Statistically appropriate loss function for modeling count data or event rates.
* **Cons:**
    * Assumes the mean equals the variance, which is often violated in real-world count data (overdispersion or underdispersion).
    * Requires predicted rates ($\hat y_i$) to be strictly positive. Using log-rates as input (`log_input=True`) handles this.
* **When to Use:**
    * Regression tasks where the target variable is a count (number of occurrences, number of items).
    * Modeling event rates (e.g., number of clicks per hour).
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When the count data is overdispersed (variance > mean) - consider Negative Binomial loss.
    * When the target variable is not a count.

### 7.2 Cosine Proximity Loss

* **Definition:** A slight variation on Cosine Embedding Loss, often used to *maximize* cosine similarity directly. It's simply the negative cosine similarity.
    $L = -\cos(x_1, x_2) = - \frac{x_1 \cdot x_2}{\|x_1\| \|x_2\|}$
    *(Note: Sometimes defined as $1 - \cos(x_1, x_2)$, identical to the $y=1$ case of Cosine Embedding Loss).*
* **Intuition:** Drives the cosine similarity between two vectors towards 1 (i.e., minimizes the angle between them).
* **Code Snippet (PyTorch - often used via `F.cosine_similarity`):**
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    # Example embeddings to be made similar
    embedding1 = torch.randn(5, 128, requires_grad=True)
    embedding2 = torch.randn(5, 128, requires_grad=True) # Could be target embeddings

    # Calculate negative cosine similarity (to be minimized)
    loss = -F.cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2).mean()
    # Or equivalently: 1 - F.cosine_similarity(...).mean()
    # loss = (1 - F.cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)).mean()
    print(loss)
    ```
* **Example Output:** `tensor(-0.0123)` (Value is negative since we minimize `-cos`, depends on random embeddings)
* **Pros:**
    * Directly optimizes for maximum cosine similarity, useful in representation learning.
* **Cons:**
    * Can potentially lead to trivial solutions (e.g., embeddings collapsing to zero) if not properly regularized or constrained.
    * Ignores magnitude information.
* **When to Use:**
    * Self-supervised learning frameworks (e.g., SimSiam, BYOL) where you want representations of augmented views of the same image to be highly similar.
    * Any task where maximizing the angular similarity between embedding vectors is the primary goal.
* **When to Avoid:**
    * When magnitude matters or when stability issues arise without additional techniques (like stop-gradients or batch normalization used in specific frameworks).
    * When dissimilar items also need to be handled (use Cosine Embedding Loss or Triplet/Contrastive Loss).

---

**General Suggestions:**

* **Match Assumptions:** Choose a loss function whose underlying assumptions match your data distribution (e.g., Gaussian noise -> MSE, Counts -> Poisson) and task objective (e.g., Overlap -> Dice/IoU, Ranking -> Margin/Listwise).
* **Consider Evaluation Metric:** If possible, use a loss function that closely relates to your final evaluation metric (e.g., optimize IoU Loss if evaluation is based on IoU).
* **Combine Losses:** It's often beneficial to combine losses (e.g., Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss for segmentation) to leverage the strengths of each.
* **Experiment:** Theoretical properties are a guide, but empirical performance on your specific dataset is key. Try different suitable loss functions and tune their hyperparameters (like margins, $\delta$, $\gamma$).
* **Check Implementation Details:** Be aware of subtle differences in library implementations (e.g., `BCELoss` vs `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, input expectations for `CrossEntropyLoss`, `PoissonNLLLoss`).
